This is a small test to quickly look at radiation accuracy.

The test is a cube of gas, with 8 particles at the corners of a unit
cube centered on zero, and the rest of the gas Poisson distributed.
Stars are place in a cube of .25 width in one corner.

Gasoline needs to be compile with -DBALLS so that the luminosity of
each star is 1.
